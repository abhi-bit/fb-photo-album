1. FB auth piece is in-built in the code.
2. For rest api used tastipie
3. All photo info is there in models
4. setup.py is there for setting-up & registering the app to pypi.
5. Used celery for polling every 10 mins.

To test out the app after running "python ../manage.py runserver"

1. http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth >> authenticates you to fb + gets an auth token
2. http://127.0.0.1:8000/get-photo/ >> Will ask for Album name that you want to sync(works just like grep, case insensitive and accepts partial names too)
This also makes sure that time since app started hasn't expired + less than 12 photos are there in album + polls every 10 mins

Rest api to show photo urls >> curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/snap/?format=json

For polling I used celery and rabbitmq. Steps to use that:

rabbitmq-server
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py celeryd â€”log-level=info
python manage.py runserver
